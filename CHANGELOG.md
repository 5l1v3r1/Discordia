# Changelog

### 1.0.0 - not yet released
*Like the version it describes, this changelog section is unfinished, and may not reflect the final state of the Discordia 1.0.0 release.*
- All mentions of "server" or "Server" have been changed to "guild" or "Guild".
- Objects created by the client via the REST API are now cached, and the same object is later returned on the corresponding WebSocket event
- Objects are now updated as soon as they are edited via REST rather than waiting for a WebSocket update
- The `Member` class no longer inherits from the `User` class; it wraps it instead, and provides only some of the same functionality.
  - The member object of a user may be obtained by calling `User:getMembership(guild)`. The user object of a member may be obtained by accessing `member.user`.
  - Shortcuts to user properties are provided. For example, `member.user.id` can be accessed as `member.id`.
  - `user.name` is always a shortcut for `user.username`.
  - `member.username` is always a shortcut for `member.user.username`.
  - `member.nickname` is a shortcut for `member.nick`
  - `member.name` is a shortcut for `member.nick` when it exists, or `member.user.username` when it does not exist.
  - All users objects are cached relative to the client instance. This allows user objects to be re-used across guilds, messages, and channels.
  - Message authors are now always user objects. Private message recipients remain user objects.
  - If a message belongs to a guild channel, there may be a shortcut to access the membership of that message's author (not finalized).
- Utility classes are added to the `discordia` module, along with the pre-existing `Color` and `Permissions` classes. Most users won't need to construct their own instances, but the opportunity is provided:
  - `Cache` - Provides convenient access to Discord objects, and allows for easier adding and removing of objects during event handling.
  - `Container` - The base class for all Discord objects, including Snowflake objects, VoiceStates, and Invites.
  - `Deque` - A double-ended queue. Existed in the original library, but only now exposed.
  - `OrderedCache` - Functions like a cache, but maintains order by using a doubly-linked list. Used for message caching.
  - `RateLimiter` - Used to delay specific REST calls to prevent 429 HTTP errors.
  - `Stopwatch` - A convenience class for keeping track of miscellaneous operations.
- `console` module added to global environment to supplement `print` and `error`:
  - `success` prints a message with green highlighting
  - `warning` prints a message with blue highlighting
  - `failure` prints a message with red highlighting, dumps a traceback, and terminates the program
- `endpoints` module removed; all endpoints are managed in the API class
- `class` module now supports accessor properties
- `class` module now has an optional memory-optimized mode
- `utils` module is removed indefinitely. Most if its functionality is found throughout the library itself.
- A new `client` directory now houses all modules and classes that are closely related to client operations.
  - The `Client` class was overhauled, though it maintains most of its original behavior:
    - Users are warned to not use email login
    - Tokens resulting from an email login are no longer cached
    - Removed `creationix/md5` dependency, as it is no longer needed
	- Performance is increased by wrapping event emissions with a coroutine only if the event has a handler subscribed.
	- `Client` `request`, `getToken`, and `getGateway` methods were moved to `API` class.
	- Cache accessors have been slightly overhauled. Consult documentation following release.
	- Cache iterators have been introduced. Consult documentation following release.
  - A new `API` class used to call REST methods is introduced
    - All interaction with the Discord API is done through this class, either by the end-user or the library itself. Most users will not need to access this class directly, but the opportunity is there.
	- Wrapper functions that make API requests will return success/failure booleans in the absence of an object.
	- Most of the methods are automatically generated by parsing the official Discord documentation.
  - The `Websocket` class was renamed to `Socket` and overhauled
    - Upgraded to gateway v5
	- Payload, heartbeat, and connection handling is now more tightly bound to the `Socket` class than to the parent `Client` class
  - The `events` module was renamed to `EventHandler`, though it maintains its singleton-like behavior.
    - Performance is increased by not automatically camelifying entire payload tables.
    - The `raw` event now provides the raw JSON string that serves as the source to the already provided raw Lua table
	- Payload parsing was rewritten entirely from scratch to utilize console warnings and cache objects. Caching is now more robust, and informative.
	- GUILD_SYNC is now handled
	- MESSAGE_DELETE_BULK is now handled
	- MESSAGE_ACK handling and `messageAcknowledge` event were removed indefinitely
	- `memberBan` and `memberUnban` were changed to `userBan` and `userUnban`, respectively, and now provide a `User` object instead of a `Member` object.
	- GUILD_CREATE handling now results in either `guildAvailable` (for when a known guild becomes available), `guildCreateUnavailable` (for when an unknown guild becomes known, but is unavailable), or `guildCreate` (for when an unknown guild becomes known and is available) events.
	- GUILD_DELETE handling now results in either `guildUnavailable` (for when a known guild becomes available) or `guildDelete` (for when a known guild is deleted).
- Some Discord object classes overhauled
  - `Container` acts as a base class to all Discord objects, and provides access to an object's `parent` object and `client`.
  - All Discord objects that have a snowflake ID inherit from the `Snowflake` class, which inherits from `Container`, and provides access to an object's `id` and `createdAt` time.
  - `guild.channels` has been split into `guild.textChannels` and `guild.voiceChannels`.
  - `PermissionOverwrite` is now a distinguished class that inherits from `Snowflake`.
  - All combinations of channel types now have their own classes.
    - `Channel` is an abstract class that inherits from `Snowflake`.
    - `GuildChannel`, `PrivateChannel`, `TextChannel`, and `VoiceChannel` are abstract classes that inherit from `Channel`.
	- `GuildTextChannel`, `GuildVoiceChannel`, and `PrivateTextChannel` are tangible classes that inherit from the appropriate classes above.
	- There is no `PrivateVoiceChannel` class.
  - `TextChannel`
    - `getMessageHistory` now returns an `OrderedCache` instead of a pure Lua table
    - `getMessageHistory` default limit restored to the Discord default of 50
    - `getMessageHistory[Before|After|Around]` have been implemented
	- `getPinnedMessages` has been implemented
	- Pinned messages are now fully handled
